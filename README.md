# VLAN-Project
This is a SImple VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) Project made by using Cisco Packet Tracer that provide a brief knowledge of VLAN"s in networking....
VLAN Configuration with Packet Tracer
In this networking project, I utilized Packet Tracer to design and implement a Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) setup. The project involved configuring two VLANs, VLAN 10 and VLAN 20, across a network of 4 PCs and 2 switches.

Key Components:

VLANs: Created VLAN 10 and VLAN 20 on the switches to segment the network into distinct broadcast domains. VLANs help in organizing network devices, enhancing security by isolating different groups, and reducing broadcast traffic.
Routers: Configured routing between VLANs using two routers. Implemented a trunk link to facilitate communication between VLANs and ensure proper data flow across the network.
Switches: Set up trunk ports on the switches to carry traffic from multiple VLANs. This setup enables VLAN tagging, allowing for effective data segmentation and network efficiency.
Additional Insights on VLANs:

Network Segmentation: VLANs allow for logical grouping of devices regardless of their physical location, which helps in organizing the network more efficiently and simplifying management.
Improved Security: By isolating different segments of the network, VLANs enhance security by limiting the scope of broadcast traffic and reducing potential security breaches.
Broadcast Control: VLANs minimize broadcast traffic by confining broadcast domains to individual VLANs, thereby improving overall network performance.
This project demonstrates the practical application of VLANs for network segmentation, the importance of trunking in inter-VLAN routing, and the benefits of organized and secure network architecture.
